      <h2>Watcher | Computed Properties</h2>
      <p>While computed properties are more appropriate in most cases, there are times when a custom watcher is necessary. That's why Vue provides a more generic way to react to data changes through the watch option. This is most useful when you want to perform asynchronous or expensive operations in response to changing data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ask a 'Yes'/'No' question: 
      <input type="text" v-model="question" />
      </p>
      <p>{{ answer }}</p> 
    </div>

    <!-- and collections of general-purpose utility methods, Vue core -->
    <!-- is able to remain small by not reinventing them. This also   -->
    <!-- gives you the freedom to use what you're familiar with.      -->
